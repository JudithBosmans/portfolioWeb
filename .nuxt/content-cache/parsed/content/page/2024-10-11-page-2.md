I've always been a creative kid, but when I was 11 my mom got me drawing lessons with an artist. I really enjoyed learning about basic composition and anatomy. One day I came home with a portret of an old man I'd created by using charcoal negatively. My mom couldn't believe that I had made this drawing, and the two years later I started art school. For this and many more reasons, drawing and creating has always been special to me. However, I can't show 20 years of drawing. Therefore I've curated a selection to showcase a variety of drawings and paintings you'll find in my sketchbooks. The creations in my sketchbooks usually never take more than 15-20 minutes."}]}]}],"toc":{"title":"","searchDepth":2,"depth":2,"links":[]}},"_type":"markdown","_id":"content:page:2024-10-11-page-2.md","_source":"content","_file":"page/2024-10-11-page-2.md","_stem":"page/2024-10-11-page-2","_extension":"md"},"hash":"Jcmp5epdBg"}
