<div class="introPage">

At MIND and Multimedia I've both had classes around development and web development. At Multec we learned how to make fullstack websites and focus was put at frontend and backend. At Mind the focus was mainly design. Throughout the years and courses I've made multiple works that I'd like to showcase.
