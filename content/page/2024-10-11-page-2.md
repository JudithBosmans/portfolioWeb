<div class="page-body mt-10 mb-20 w-60vw">

During the past years I've filled up many sketchbooks. I've always been a creative kid, but when I was 11 my mom got me drawing lessons with an artist. I really enjoyed learning about basic composition and anatomy. One day I came home with a portret of an old man I'd created by using charcoal negatively. My mom couldn't believe that I had made this drawing, and the two years later I started art school. For this and many more reasons, drawing and creating has always been special to me. However, I can't show 20 years of drawing. Therefore I've curated a selection to showcase a variety of drawings and paintings you'll find in my sketchbooks. The creations in my sketchbooks usually never take more than 15-20 minutes.
