The poet [Homer](https://www.biography.com/writer/homer)’s 8th-century BC epics, *The Iliad* and *The Odyssey*, for example, tell the story of the [Trojan War](https://www.history.com/topics/ancient-history/trojan-war) as a divine conflict as well as a human one. They do not, however, bother to introduce the gods and goddesses who are their main characters, since readers and listeners would already have been familiar with them.

Around 700 BC, the poet Hesiod’s *Theogony* offered the first written cosmogony, or origin story, of Greek mythology. The *Theogony* tells the story of the universe’s journey from nothingness (Chaos, a primeval void) into being, and details an elaborate family tree of elements, gods and goddesses who evolved from Chaos and descended from Gaia (Earth), Ouranos (Sky), Pontos (Sea) and Tartaros (the Underworld).

Later Greek writers and artists used and elaborated upon these sources in their own work. For instance, mythological figures and events appear in the 5th-century plays of Aeschylus, Sophocles and [Euripides](https://www.biography.com/writer/euripides) and the lyric poems of Pindar. Writers such as the 2nd-century BC Greek mythographer Apollodorus of Athens and the 1st-century BC Roman historian Gaius Julius Hyginus compiled the ancient myths and legends for contemporary audiences.
